# Java Bootcamp â€” My Learning Journey as a Junior Java Developer

This repository contains my solutions to exercises from the [Java Jump Bootcamp](https://girlscodefun.pl/en/projects/java-jump-summer-bootcamp/).  
The code is organized by **weeks** and further divided into **sections**, each focusing on a specific topic.  
I also included unit tests for selected tasks.

## Week 1: Loops, Conditionals & Collections
- **Topics:** basics of iteration, conditionals, arrays, and simple collections.
- **Focus:** Mastered core Java control structures and data handling with arrays, lists, and maps, building a solid foundation for algorithmic problem-solving.
- **Structure:**
    - [Section 01](https://github.com/NicoleHoppy/JavaBootcamp/tree/main/src/main/java/pl/javaexercises/week01/section01) â†’ control flow with loops (`for`) and conditionals (`if/else`, logical operators).
    - [Section 02](https://github.com/NicoleHoppy/JavaBootcamp/tree/main/src/main/java/pl/javaexercises/week01/section02) â†’ arrays: initialization, traversal, searching, aggregating (sum, max, average).
    - [Section 03](https://github.com/NicoleHoppy/JavaBootcamp/tree/main/src/main/java/pl/javaexercises/week01/section03) â†’ collections: working with `List` and `Map`, filtering, counting, and simple data modeling with custom classes.

## Week 2: Strings, Validation & OOP
- **Topics:** advanced string operations, input validation, parsing, object-oriented programming.
- **Focus:** Gained strong text-processing and validation skills while applying OOP principles (inheritance, interfaces, abstraction, polymorphism) to model real-world scenarios.
- **Structure:**
    - [Section 01](https://github.com/NicoleHoppy/JavaBootcamp/tree/main/src/main/java/pl/javaexercises/week02/section01) â†’ Practiced working with text by implementing algorithms for palindromes, vowel counting, word counting, case transformations, string sanitization, and replacing digits with words.
    - [Section 02](https://github.com/NicoleHoppy/JavaBootcamp/tree/main/src/main/java/pl/javaexercises/week02/section02) â†’ Built utilities for validating task descriptions, emails, and passwords, as well as parsing structured strings and performing text analysis (word and character frequency).
    - [Section 03](https://github.com/NicoleHoppy/JavaBootcamp/tree/main/src/main/java/pl/javaexercises/week02/section03) â†’   Applied OOP principles by designing class hierarchies (`Animal`, `Dog`, `Cat`, `Vehicle`, `Car`), interfaces (`Playable`, `Shape`, `Completable`), and abstract classes (`Payment`). Modeled real-world concepts with `Project` and `Task`, practicing inheritance, aggregation, and polymorphism.

## Week 3: Advanced Collections, Streams & Exception Handling

- **Topics:** object equality and hashing, sorting with `Comparable` and `Comparator`, Java Streams for data processing, and custom exception handling.
- **Focus:** Advanced collection handling and custom sorting with Comparable and Comparator, combined with robust error handling through custom exceptions.
- **Structure:**
    - [Section 01](https://github.com/NicoleHoppy/JavaBootcamp/tree/main/src/main/java/pl/javaexercises/week03/section01) â†’ Practiced implementing `equals()` and `hashCode()` for uniqueness (`Book`, `Employee`) and used `Comparable`/`Comparator` for custom sorting (`Student`, `Product`, `Osoba`). Exercises included chaining comparators, sorting collections of objects, and eliminating duplicates with `HashSet`.
    - [Section 02](https://github.com/NicoleHoppy/JavaBootcamp/tree/main/src/main/java/pl/javaexercises/week03/section02) â†’ Explored Java Streams for filtering, mapping, reducing, and collecting data. Tasks included counting elements above thresholds, transforming lists (squares, word lengths), extracting unique values, sorting, finding maximums, and working with `Optional` results.
    - [Section 03](https://github.com/NicoleHoppy/JavaBootcamp/tree/main/src/main/java/pl/javaexercises/week03/section03) â†’ Learned how to design and throw custom exceptions (`InvalidTaskException`, `TooYoungException`). Implemented validation logic in constructors and methods, then handled errors gracefully with `try-catch` to ensure robust program behavior and user-friendly messages.

## Week 4: Unit Testing with JUnit & Mockito
- **Topics:** fundamentals of unit testing, assertions in JUnit 5, mocking with Mockito, testing services and repositories.
- **Focus:** Developed professional testing practices, writing maintainable unit tests with JUnit and Mockito to ensure reliability, isolation, and correctness of code.
- **Structure:**
    - [Code](https://github.com/NicoleHoppy/JavaBootcamp/tree/main/src/main/java/pl/javaexercises/week04) â†’ services, repositories, user management, tasks
    - [Tests](https://github.com/NicoleHoppy/JavaBootcamp/tree/main/src/test/java/pl/javaexercises/week04) â†’ JUnit tests for calculators, string utilities, services & repositories

## ðŸš€ Notes for Recruiters
- This repository demonstrates my **step-by-step learning progress** in Java.
- Each week covers **increasingly advanced concepts**: from basics (loops, arrays) to OOP, interfaces, and unit testing.
- The code is structured, version-controlled, and continuously improved as I progress in the bootcamp.
