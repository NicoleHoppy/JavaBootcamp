### Week 1 / Section 02 — Arrays & Basic Data Processing

**Focus:** Practicing array creation, iteration, and basic operations on collections of numbers.  
This section shows my ability to traverse arrays, analyze their contents, and implement simple algorithms like searching, counting, and aggregating values.

**🎯 Key exercises:**
1. **Array initialization & iteration** → created an `int[]` with 5 numbers and printed each element using both `for` and `for-each` loops.
2. **Counting elements by condition** → iterated through an array to count how many numbers are greater than 10.
3. **Finding the maximum** → traversed an array to determine the largest value.
4. **Summing values** → calculated the sum of all integers in an array using a loop.
5. **Reversing output** → printed array elements in reverse order.
6. **Element frequency** → counted how many times a given number occurs in an array.
7. **Average calculation** → computed the arithmetic mean of elements in a `double[]`.

**🏋️ Skills demonstrated:**
- Array initialization and iteration (`for`, `for-each`).
- Applying conditions and counters while traversing arrays.
- Implementing algorithms for **max value, sum, reverse order, frequency count, average**.
- Strengthening problem-solving by combining loops and conditional logic.

**💻 Terminal output:**
