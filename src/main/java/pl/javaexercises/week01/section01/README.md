### Week 1 / Section 01 — Loops & Conditionals

**Focus:** Practicing fundamental control structures in Java: loops, conditional statements, and operators.  
This section demonstrates my ability to write simple but correct programs that process input, evaluate conditions, and produce expected output.

**🎯 Key exercises:**
1. **Printing sequences** → used `for` loops to print numbers in order (1–10).
2. **Printing sequences** → used `for` loops to print numbers in reverse (10–1).
3. **Even numbers filtering** → applied `if` with modulo operator `%` to print only even numbers in a range.
4. **Number classification** → checked whether a number is positive, negative, or zero.
5. **Divisibility checks** → determined if a number is divisible by 3 and 5 using `%` and logical operators (`&&`).
6. **Odd/Even detection** → read an integer and identified if it is even or odd.
7. **Age validation** → read user age and classified as *Adult* (18+) or *Minor*.
8. **Maximum of three numbers** → compared three integers using nested `if` statements to find the largest.

**🏋️ Skills demonstrated:**
- Writing and controlling loops (`for`).
- Using conditional statements (`if`, `else if`, `else`).
- Applying logical (`&&`) and arithmetic operators (`%`).
- Handling simple user input and providing meaningful output.

**💻 Terminal output:**
