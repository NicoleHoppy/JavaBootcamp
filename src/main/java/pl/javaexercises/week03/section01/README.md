### Week 3 / Section 01 ‚Äî Equality, Hashing & Sorting

**Focus:** Understanding how objects are compared, how uniqueness is enforced in collections, and how to implement sorting using `Comparable`, `Comparator`, and utility methods.

**üéØ Key exercises:**
1. **Book equality with HashSet** ‚Üí created a `Book` class (`title`, `author`, `year`) and implemented `equals()` and `hashCode()` so that two books are considered equal if they share the same title and author. Verified that duplicates are ignored in a `HashSet`.
2. **Student sorting by grades (Comparable)** ‚Üí implemented `Comparable<Student>` to sort students in descending order of average grade using `Collections.sort()`.
3. **Student sorting by name (Comparator)** ‚Üí defined a custom `Comparator<Student>` to sort students alphabetically by name.
4. **Employee uniqueness by ID** ‚Üí created an `Employee` class with `id`, `name`, and `position`. Implemented `equals()` and `hashCode()` so uniqueness is based solely on `id`, ensuring no duplicate employees are added to a `HashSet`.
5. **Product multi-level sorting** ‚Üí used a chain of comparators to sort `Product` objects first by ascending price, then by descending rating if prices are equal.
6. **Sorting integers** ‚Üí read five integers from input, stored them in an array, and sorted them with `Arrays.sort()`.
7. **Sorting people by age** ‚Üí built a `Person` class (`name`, `age`) and sorted a list of objects by ascending age using a `Comparator`.
8. **Alphabetical string sorting** ‚Üí sorted a list of names (`String`) in alphabetical order.

**üèãÔ∏è Skills demonstrated:**
- Implementing **`equals()` and `hashCode()`** correctly to ensure consistent object equality and uniqueness in sets.
- Using the **Comparable interface** for natural ordering of objects.
- Applying **Comparator** for custom and multi-level sorting logic.
- Sorting both **primitive types** (arrays) and **objects** (lists).
- Understanding the role of **collections (`HashSet`, `List`)** in managing data with uniqueness and order.
